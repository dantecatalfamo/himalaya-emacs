* Himalaya Emacs
  [[https://melpa.org/#/himalaya][file:https://melpa.org/packages/himalaya-badge.svg]]

  Emacs front-end for the email client [[https://github.com/pimalaya/himalaya][Himalaya CLI]].

** Installation

   =himalaya-emacs= is available on MELPA.

   You can also install it using =use-package=.

   1. Clone the repository using git to your desired location.
      In this example I'll use
      =~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs=.
   2. Add the following =use-package= declaration to your =init.el=
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package himalaya
        :if (file-exists-p "~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs")
        :load-path "~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs")
      #+end_src

      This will load =himalaya-emacs= when it's available, but stop it
      from throwing errors if you haven't cloned it.

** Customization

   system. =M-x customize-group himalaya=
