* Himalaya Emacs
  Emacs front-end for the [[https://github.com/soywod/himalaya][himalaya]] email client.

  This is currently a work in progress.

** Installation

   =himalaya-emacs= will be submitted to MELPA once it is stable.

   Until then, you can easily install it using =use-package=.

   1. Clone the repository using git to your desired location.
      In this example I'll use
      =~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs=.
   2. Add the following =use-package= declaration to your =init.el=
      #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package himalaya
        :if (file-exists-p "~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs")
        :load-path "~/src/github.com/dantecatalfamo/himalaya-emacs")
      #+end_src

      This will load =himalaya-emacs= when it's available, but stop it
      from throwing errors if you haven't cloned it.

** Customization

   Most settings can be customized through the Emacs Easy Customize
   system. =M-x customize-group himalaya=

** List emails

   =M-x himalaya= or =M-x himalaya-email-list=
